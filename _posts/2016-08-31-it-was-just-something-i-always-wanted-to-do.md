# Something Small

It was just something I always wanted to do.

As a creative kid growing up in Texas, I had a fascination with the re-creation of real life on a smaller scale. In school, a friend and I created an entire city on scrolls of paper. As I got older, and got involved in theater, I was fascinated by set design (and honestly, had I been paying attention, I should have likely followed that path). In my bedroom I would use cardboard, Lego blocks, paper, and any other materials I could find lying about the house to build set models of the plays I was reading.

As an adult, small scale was always in the back of my mind. I eventually bit the bullet that launched what may very well be my new passion, or awakened an old one. I bought a Newport Victorian dollhouse kit from [Real Good Toys][0], a dollhouse manufacturer based in Vermont. Inspired by the brilliance of [Noel and Pat Thomas][1], I envisioned building a dollhouse that told a story, was realistic, and allowed me to create a world where anything was possible. I may never reach the heights of the Thomas's, but in the meantime, let me take you on the journey of realizing my vision through the magical world of minature.
